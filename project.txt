Let us go then, you and I, when the evening is stretched out against the sky, like a patient etherised upon a 
table. Let us go down certain half deserted streets, the muttering retreats of restless nights in one night 
cheap hotels and sawdust restaurants with oyster shells. Streets that follow like a tedious argument of 
insidious intent that leads you to an overwhelming question. Oh, do not ask "what is it?" Let us go and make our 
visit.

In the room where the women come and go, talking of Michaelangelo.
